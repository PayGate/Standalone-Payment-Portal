## Paygate Standalone Payment Portal v1.1.0

This is the Paygate Standalone Payment Portal. Please feel free to contact the Payfast support team at
support@payfast.help should you require any assistance.

## Installation

1. **Download the Integration**

  - Visit the [releases page](https://github.com/PayGate/PayWeb_Standalone_Payment_Portal/releases) and
  download [public_html.zip](https://github.com/Paygate/PayWeb_Standalone_Payment_Portal/releases/download/v1.1.0/public_html.zip).

2. **Install the Integration**

  - Extract the contents of the **public_html.zip** file to your preferred location on your computer.
  - Upload the content of the **public_html** folder into your server's document root directory. The portal should work on
  any web hosting provider that supports PHP 8.1 and higher. Contact your web hosting provider if you are unsure.

3. **Configure the Plugin**

  - Navigate to the domain of your web browser. The **Installation Wizard** will load. Enter all the relevant fields,
  mimicking the format of the examples provided as prompted. Be careful to leave out full stops at the end of each text
  field. Also, don't add a slash at the end of your **Base Url**. You should now click the **Save** button. After saving,
  the **Create Transaction** page will display, and the **Installation Wizard** page will be disabled.
  - Check your new **Terms and Conditions** page for correctness. Be sure to look-out for typos and appropriateness for
  your organization. We recommend having a legal professional examine this on your behalf.
  - If you would like to edit your existing settings, open up **includes/_env.php**, which the portal created on the
  server when you ran the installation. Use a text editor to alter any of the values between each set of double-quotes.
  Should you wish to re-install, repeat step 2.
